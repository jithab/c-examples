To load a shared object (SO) file dynamically in C, you can use the **dlopen**, **dlsym**, and **dlclose** functions provided by the **dlfcn.h** library. These functions allow you to load a shared library at runtime, look up symbols (functions or variables) in the shared library, and close the shared library when done.

- See compile.sh
